Bake
====

Bake is a small task manager for JavaScript developers that supercharges the
`scripts` entry in your `package.json`. It works by sending your build tasks to
a terminal multiplexer such as [tmux][1]. Using Bake, you keep your log files
clean and separated and get parallel builds for free.
